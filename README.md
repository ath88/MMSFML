Combining ManyMouse and SFML

Someone asked me to help them with making ManyMouse and SFML work together. This is a minimal implementation of such program.

Make sure you have the compiled SFML located in your environment. The Code::Blocks project currently expects them to be in the following locations;

Linux: /usr/local

Windows: C:/Program Files (x86)/SFML
